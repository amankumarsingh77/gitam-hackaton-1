    content: `üìö Introduction:

Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in our universe. They are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing‚Äîno particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light‚Äîcan escape from it. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.

üí° Fun Fact:
Despite their name, black holes are not empty spaces. They are actually incredibly dense masses of matter compressed into a very small space.

üéØ Core Concepts:

üìç Formation of Black Holes:
Black holes form when very massive stars die. When a star with more than about 20 times the mass of our Sun runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity. The collapse is so extreme that it forms a black hole.

üìç Event Horizon:
The event horizon is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape. Once something crosses the event horizon, it will inevitably be pulled toward the center of the black hole.

üìç Types of Black Holes:
Scientists classify black holes into three types:
- Stellar black holes: Form from the collapse of a single massive star
- Intermediate black holes: Have masses between 100 and 100,000 times that of our Sun
- Supermassive black holes: Found at the centers of galaxies, with masses millions or billions of times that of our Sun

üñºÔ∏è Visual Aids:

The structure of a black hole includes:
- The singularity at the center
- The event horizon surrounding it
- The accretion disk of matter spiraling into the black hole

üéÆ Interactive Activities:

Quiz:
Question: What is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape?
Options:
- Accretion disk
- Event horizon
- Singularity
- Gravitational lens
Correct Answer: Event horizon
Explanation: The event horizon is the point of no return around a black hole. Once anything crosses this boundary, it cannot escape the black hole's gravitational pull, not even light.

Quiz:
Question: How do stellar black holes form?
Options:
- From the collision of neutron stars
- From the collapse of massive stars
- From the expansion of white dwarfs
- From the explosion of supernovas
Correct Answer: From the collapse of massive stars
Explanation: Stellar black holes form when massive stars (typically more than 20 times the mass of our Sun) exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse under their own gravity.

üìù Summary:

Black holes are extraordinary cosmic objects with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. They form from the collapse of massive stars and come in different sizes, from stellar to supermassive. Understanding black holes helps us comprehend the extreme physics of our universe and the life cycle of stars.`,
